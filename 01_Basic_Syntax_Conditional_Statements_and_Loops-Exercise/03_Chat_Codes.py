# Peter is a programming enthusiast who wants to create a chat where people will send messages via number codes.
# He starts by creating a program for only four messages. Create a program that receives the n number of messages sent.
# On the following n lines, it will receive integer numbers.For each number,the program should print different message:
# 路 If the number is 88 - "Hello"
# 路 If the number is 86 - "How are you?"
# 路 If the number is not 88 nor 86, and it is below 88 - "GREAT!"
# 路 If the number is over 88 - "Bye."

# number_of_messages = int(input())
#
# for message in range(number_of_messages):
#     current_number = int(input())
#
#     if current_number == 88:
#         print("Hello")
#     elif current_number == 86:
#         print("How are you?")
#     elif current_number < 88:
#         print("GREAT!")
#     else:
#         print("Bye.")

# ALTERNATIVELY:


number_of_messages = int(input())

for message in range(number_of_messages):
    current_number = int(input())
    current_message = ""

    if current_number == 88:
        current_message = "Hello"
    elif current_number == 86:
        current_message = "How are you?"
    elif current_number < 88:
        current_message = "GREAT!"
    else:
        current_message = "Bye."

    print(current_message)
